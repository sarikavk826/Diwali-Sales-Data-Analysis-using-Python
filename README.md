# Diwali-Sales-Data-Analysis-using-Python
This project analyzes Diwali sales data to uncover insights about customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and sales performance.

Using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project performs data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to identify key patterns such as:

Which age group and gender spent the most during Diwali
Which state and occupation contributed most to total sales
Which product categories performed the best
The goal is to help businesses understand customer purchasing trends and make data-driven marketing decisions during festive seasons.
